# housing-market-investment-classifier
Classifying safe and risky investment in housing market using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn in iPython Notebook 
environment.

This is for all purposes my first project in prediction modelling. Before I go into details of explaining my thinking and intuition 
for this, I would like to give credit to @sentdex channel on YouTube for getting me started on it.

The Housing Market in US has always been a attractive investment alternative. Although the 2009 crisis tarnished it's attractiveness and 
shoeed away a lot of investers, I would like to claimy that the Housing Market is slowing climbing back to it's past glory. Therefore, 
having a model which could tell which month will see a rise in the market and which month would not is an asset.

This is my attempt building such a model. In a nutshell, I have to tried to marry all the 'features' that I think might influence or help
predict the Housing Market together and then used Logistic Regression algorithm to classify the monthly market as Invest(1) or Exercise 
Caution(0). I achieved a accuracy of around 75% for this. However, I think varying the lamda value(regularization value) might improve 
the accuracy a bit.
